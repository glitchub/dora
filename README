Dora is an embeddable dhcp client and test tool. It can communicate with DHCP
servers to obtain, renew, and release leases. However it does not configure
interfaces or wait for lease timeouts, etc, this the responsibility of the
invoking process.

Dora performs privileged network operations, which probably means it has to be
run as root.

In all cases, if dora completes successfully it terminates with exit status 0.

If a lease is obtained then a single line is written to stdout in form:

    address subnet gateway nameserver domain dhcpserver lease-seconds

To obtain a lease (on an unconfigured interface):

    $ dora eth0
    192.168.1.117 255.255.254.0 192.168.0.1 8.8.8.8 localdomain 192.168.1.254 86400

To renew a lease at time T1:

    $ dora -l -s xx.xx.xx.xx eth0
    192.168.1.117 255.255.254.0 192.168.0.1 8.8.8.8 localdomain 192.168.1.254 86400

    The DHCP server address must be specified.

To rebind a lease at time T2 (if the renew failed):

    $ dora -L eth0
    192.168.1.117 255.255.254.0 192.168.0.1 8.8.8.8 localdomain 192.168.1.254 86400

To release a previously obtained lease:

    $ dora -r -s xx.xx.xx.xx eth0

    The DHCP server must be specified. There is no output.

To obtain local network information on an interface already configured with
static IP address:

    $ dora -i eth0
    192.168.1.117 255.255.254.0 192.168.0.1 8.8.8.8 localdomain 192.168.1.254 0

    This uses a DHCPINFORM message, the response doesn't include a lease time
    (because it is not a lease) so it is reported as 0.

Options:

    -c ipaddress - request client address

        For normal dhcp, this defines a desired IP address, which the server is
        under no obligation to provide. For other operations if this is
        specified it will ovedwrrides the existing interface address.

    -d - just broadcast a discover and print all offers.

        This is can be used to determine which servers are active on the
        interface. Extended format is used for each response. Add -O to see
        full list of options provided by each server.

    -f - force operation even if interface already has an address

        Normally dora will refuse to request an IP address if the interface
        already has one, use -f to make it try anyway. Note this may invalidate
        the existing lease, if the result has a different IP address then the
        interface should be reconfigured.

    -h hostname - request specific hostname

        Some DHCP servers will register the specified hostname with the local
        DNS server, so that it will resolve to the assigned IP. Some won't.
        YMMV.

    -i - elicit local network information for current interface addres

        As discussed, this can be used to obtain DHCP information for a static
        IP address, without actually leasing the address. If the address
        actually is assigned by DHCP, the server may choose to populate the
        lease field with the remaining time. Or not.

    -l - renew the lease for the current interface address, requires -s

        Renew the current lease. This is typically performed after lease*0.5
        seconds. The interface must be configure and the dhcp server address is
        required. Add -c to renew some other address, but note if the interface
        doesn't have that address then response won't be received..

    -L - rebind the lease for the current interface address.

        If renew fails for some reason, the rebind can be used typically after
        lease*.075 seconds. This is broadcast so the server address isn't
        required. If the rebind fails, then the interface is supposed to be
        de-configured when the lease expires. Add -c to rebind some other
        address.

    -o number - request DHCP option 1 to 254, can used multple times, implies -x

        Dora always requests the subnet, router, dns server, domain  name,
        broadcast address, and lease seconds from the server. This allows you
        to request other options as well, which the server may or may not
        respond to.

    -O - request all 254 possible DHCP options, implies -x

        This is simply shorthand for "-o1 -o2 -o3..." etc, allows you to see
        what options a server actually does return. Useful with -d for probing
        DHCP servers. Automatically enables extended output.

    -r - release the lease for the current interface address.

        As discussed above, attempts to release the lease for the current
        address. If -s is given it will be unicast to the specified server,
        otherwise it will be broadcast. Add -c to release some other address.

     -s ipaddress - unicast to DHCP server address.

        Used with various operations to specifiy the target DHCP server. The
        interface must be configured in order for unicast to work.

     -t number - initial receive timeout seconds, default is 4

     -u number - transmit attempts, default is 4

        This defines how many times to resend a DHCPREQUEST if an ACK is not
        received. Note each attempt extends the timeout by about one second
        (randomized), so "-t 4 -u 4" will timeout after about 22 seconds,
        "-t 4 -u 5" will timeout after about 30 seconds, etc.

     -v - dump various status messages and other information to stderr

        Includes dump of the sent as received packets, explanation as to why
        packets are rejected, etc. This information always goes to stderr so
        will not interfere with scripted output processing.

     -x - output extended result report to stdout, one DHCP option per line

        This supercedes the single-line output format, and prints each received
        DHCP option in the form:

            option description: value

        "option" is the decimal option number, as defined at
        https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2132#ref-1.  The description is
        arbitrary text from the same RFC, but does not contain spaces.

        The value is whatever was provided by the server for this option, such
        as an IP address. Some options provide arbitrary strings which may
        contain whitespace, or even be empty. Note control characters and other
        weirdness are converted to '?'.

        Option code 0 is used to present the assigned IP address. 0 is not an
        actual DHCP option code so this allows all lines the have the same
        format.

        Some options are mandatory for normal operation, specifically the
        subnet, broadcast, router, domain name server, domain name, and lease
        time. If the server fails to provide these then dora will attempt
        synthesize them. Synthesized options are indicated by an exclamation
        point as the first character of the extended description.

        For example, the expanded version of the DHCPINFORM reponse shown
        above:

            $ ./dora -iOx eth0
            0 Address: 192.168.1.117
            51 !IP_Address_Lease_Seconds: 0
            53 DHCP_Response_Type: 5
            54 Server_Identifier: 192.168.0.1
            1 Subnet_Mask: 255.255.254.0
            28 Broadcast_Address: 192.168.1.255
            6 Domain_Name_Server: 192.168.0.1
            252 Unknown: 10
            44 NetBIOS_Over_TCP/IP_Name_Server: 192.168.0.1
            15 Domain_Name: localdomain
            3 Router: 192.168.0.1

        This shows *all* the options provided in the DHCPINFORM response
        (including option 252 which is not defined in the spec). Note a
        DHCPINFORM reply normally won't include lease seconds, so this entry
        was synthesized.
