Dora is a dhcp client and test tool. It communicates with dhcp servers but
does not lter interface configuration or manage leases.

In normal use dora is invoked for a non-configured interface, obtains an
address via DHCP and prints a single line to stdout in format:

    address netmask broadcast router dns domain server lease

For example:

    $ dora eth0
    192.168.1.117 255.255.255.254 192.168.0.1 8.8.8.8 localdomain 192.168.1.254 86400

The invoking code is responsible for configuring the interface and updating
/etc/resolv.conf. It must also store the server address and arrange for the
lease to be renewed. When the lease is 50% expired (in this case after 43200 seconds), dora can be re-invoked:

    $ dora -l -s 192.168.0.1 eth0
    192.168.1.117 255.255.255.254 192.168.0.1 8.8.8.8 localdomain 192.168.1.254 86400





The -c option can be used to request a specific IP address (the server is not obligated to honor the request):

    $ dora -c 192.168.1.200
    192.168.1.200 255.255.255.254 192.168.0.1 8.8.8.8 localdomain 192.168.1.254 86400


It is up to the calling code to use this information to configure the interface
and update resolv.conf.





The invoking program may uses this information to configure the interface and
/etc/resolv.conf. The invoking program can also keep track of the lease time
and re-invoke dora to renew when 50% of the time has expired.

dora supports the following options:

    -a address  - include the address as option 50 in the discovery packet, a
    server may choose to offer this address.

    -s server   - unicast messages to the specified server address instead of
    broadcasting.

    -t seconds  - seconds to wait for responses, default is 3.

    -r retries  - number of times to retry discovery before giving up, default
    is 4 (i.e. 12 seconds total, by default).

    -n          - send one dicovery and print all offers. Do not request the
    address. This is for testing, identifying bogus DHCP servers, etc.

    -R          - issue a DHCP renew message instead of discovery. Must specify
    the address with -a. -s may be required in the case where there is more
    than one dhcp server, otherwise the wrong server may NAK the renewal.

    -x          - in addition to the out above, also report one DHCP option per
    line in the form:

        code arbitrary text: value

    For example:

        28 Broadcast address: 192.168.1.255
