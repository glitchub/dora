dora is a stand alone dhcp client and test tool. It communicates with the dhcp
server but does not resident, assign addresses or manage leases.

Without options, other than an interface name, dora will broadcast a DHCP
discover and wait for an offer. dora broadcasts a DHCP request for the first
valid offer, and waits for an acknowledge. Finally dora prints a single line to
stdout, in the form:

    address netmask gateway dhcp domain server lease

For example:

    192.168.1.117 255.255.255.254 192.168.0.1 8.8.8.8 localdomain 192.168.1.254 86400

The invoking program may uses this information to configure the interface and
/etc/resolv.conf. The invoking program can also keep track of the lease time
and re-invoke dora to renew when 50% of the time has expired.

dora supports the following options:

    -a address  - include the address as option 50 in the discovery packet, a
    server may choose to offer this address.

    -s server   - unicast messages to the specified server address instead of
    broadcasting.

    -t seconds  - seconds to wait for responses, default is 3.

    -r retries  - number of times to retry discovery before giving up, default
    is 4 (i.e. 12 seconds total, by default).

    -n          - send one dicovery and print all offers. Do not request the
    address. This is for testing, identifying bogus DHCP servers, etc.

    -R          - issue a DHCP renew message instead of discovery. Must specify
    the address with -a. -s may be required in the case where there is more
    than one dhcp server, otherwise the wrong server may NAK the renewal.

    -x          - in addition to the out above, also report one DHCP option per
    line in the form:

        code arbitrary text: value

    For example:

        28 Broadcast address: 192.168.1.255
