Dora is an embeddable DHCP client and test tool. It can be used to obtain and
manage DHCP leases, probe subnets for DHCP servers, and query DHCP servers for
supported options.

The command format is:

    dora [options] [command [server]] interface

For most commands, dora prints lease information to stdout on a single line, in
form:

    address subnet broadcast router dnsserver domainname dhcpserver leaseseconds

For example:

    $ dora acquire eth0
    192.168.1.117 255.255.254.0 192.168.1.255 192.168.0.1 8.8.8.8 localdomain 192.168.1.254 86400

The invoking program is responsible for parsing the response in order to bring
up the interface, set the default route, configure /etc/resolv.conf, and
arrange to run dora again to renew the lease at time T1 (50% of the lease
time), rebind at time T2 (87.5% of the lease time), or acquire a new lease when
the existing lease expires.

Commands are:

    acquire - obtain a DHCP lease in the usual fashion, via broadcast. The
    interface must not be configured. This is the default if no command is
    specified at all.

    renew xx.xx.xx.xx - unicast a DHCP renew for the current configured address
    to the specified server, this is normally done when the lease is 50%
    expired (aka time T1).  If no response is received, the client tries to
    rebind at time T2.

    rebind - broadcast a DHCP renew for the current configured address, this is
    normally done when the lease is 87.5% expired (aka time T2). If no response
    is received, the client must attempt to acquire a new lease.

    release xx.xx.xx.xx - unicast a DHCP release to the specified server
    address. The server won't respond, so this command exits immediately.

    inform - broadcast a request for local network information without creating
    a lease. The interface is presumably configured with a static IP address.
    Typically the resulting lease time will be 0, since no lease is issued.
    However if the server does actually have a lease for the requesting IP it
    may return the remaining lease seconds, or it may not respond at all.

    probe - broadcast a DHCP discover and print all offers received before the
    timeout period. No lease is actually obtained, this is a way to find out if
    there are DHCP servers on the subnet. If no offers are received, report an
    error.

For all commands, if the operation completes successfully then dora terminates
with exit status 0. If not, it prints a message to stderr and exits with
non-zero status.

Options are:

    -c xx.xx.xx.xx - request client address

        For normal DHCP, this specifies an address to ask for, which the server
        is under no obligation to provide. For other operations, this will be
        used as the source address instead of the primary interface address,
        but note if the address is not actually assigned to the interface then
        the server's response can't be received.

    -f - force acquire even if interface already has an address

        Normally dora will refuse to request an IP address if the interface
        already has one, use -f to make it try anyway. This may invalidate
        the existing lease, if the result has a different IP address then the
        interface should be reconfigured.

    -h hostname - request specific hostname

        Some DHCP servers will register the specified hostname with the local
        DNS server, so that it will resolve to the assigned IP. Some won't,
        YMMV.

    -m - output the address in CIDR notation, i.e. with appended netmask width

        The resulting address is therefore compatible with 'ip address add' for
        example.

    -o number - request DHCP option 1 to 254, can used multple times, implies -x

        Dora always requests the subnet, router, dns server, domain  name,
        broadcast address, and lease seconds from the server. This allows you
        to request other options as well, which the server may or may not
        respond to.

    -O - request all 254 possible DHCP options, implies -x

        This is simply shorthand for "-o1 -o2 -o3..." etc, an easy way to probe
        a server for all options it supports.

    -t number - transaction timeout seconds, default is 4

    -u number - max transaction attempts, default is 4

        These define how often and how many times to send a request if an ack
        is not received. Each attempt extends the timeout by about one second,
        plus/minus up to 1000 random milliseconds, so "-t 4 -u 4" will timeout
        after about 22 seconds, "-t 4 -u 5" will timeout after about 30
        seconds, etc.

    -v - dump various status messages and other information to stderr

        Including packet dump, explanation as to why packets are rejected, etc.
        This information always goes to stderr so as not to interfere with
        scripted output processing.

    -x - extended result report to stdout (instead of the single line)

        The extended report prints one DHCP option per line, in the order
        provided by the host, in the form:

            option description: value

        Where:

            option is the decimal option number, as defined at
            https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2132.

            description is arbitrary text from that RFC, guaranteed to not
            contain spaces.

            value is a stringified version of whatever was provided by the
            server for the option, such as an IP address, a decimal value, or
            an arbitrary string. Note that the value may contain whitespace, or
            may even be empty, but will not control characters or non-ASCII
            weirdness.

        Option code 0 is used to present the assigned IP address. This is an
        invalid RFC2132 option, but allows all lines to have the same format.

        For example:

            $ ./dora -O inform eth0
            0 Address: 192.168.1.117
            53 DHCP_Response_Type: 5
            54 Server_Identifier: 192.168.1.254
            1 Subnet_Mask: 255.255.254.0
            28 Broadcast_Address: 192.168.1.255
            6 Domain_Name_Server: 8.8.8.8
            252 Unknown: 10
            44 NetBIOS_Over_TCP/IP_Name_Server: 192.168.1.253
            15 Domain_Name: localdomain
            3 Router: 192.168.0.1

        Note option 252 was reported by the server but is not defined by
        RF2132. An inform reply usually won't include lease seconds, so these
        don't appear in the extended output (in the brief output it would
        appear as 0).

Dora performs privileged network operations, which usually means it has to be
run as root. If a DHCP client is already listening on the specified interface
then dora will fail with "Address already in use".

To build the dora executable, just run 'make'. The result should be about 35K
bytes. 'make terse' removes help text, the -v option and the DHCP option text
(leaving only the ':' in extended output), this shrinks the executable to about
19K bytes.
