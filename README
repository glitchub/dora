Dora is an embeddable DHCP client and test tool. It is able to communicate with
DHCP servers to obtain, renew, and release leases. However it does not
configure interfaces or daemonize in order to perform lease renewal, this is
the responsibility of invoking code.

Dora performs privileged network operations, which usually means it has to be
run as root.

In all cases, if a dora operation completes successfully it terminates with
exit status 0. If not, it prints some kind of message to stderr and exits with
non-zero status).

For most operations, dora will print interesting lease information to stdout on
a single line, in form:

    address subnet broadcast router nameserver domain dhcpserver lease-seconds

The invoking program can use this information to bring up the interface, set
the default route, and configure /etc/resolv.conf.  It must also arrange to
renew the lease at time T1 (lease time * 0.5), or rebind at time T2 (lease time
* 0.875), or acquire a new lease when the existing one expires.

To obtain a lease (on an unconfigured interface):

    $ dora eth0
    192.168.1.117 255.255.254.0 192.168.1.255 192.168.0.1 8.8.8.8 localdomain 192.168.1.254 86400

To renew a lease at time T1:

    $ dora -l -s xx.xx.xx.xx eth0
    192.168.1.117 255.255.254.0 192.168.1.255 192.168.0.1 8.8.8.8 localdomain 192.168.1.254 86400

    The DHCP server address must be specified.

To rebind a lease at time T2 (if the renew failed):

    $ dora -L eth0
    192.168.1.117 255.255.254.0 192.168.1.255 192.168.0.1 8.8.8.8 localdomain 192.168.1.254 86400

To release a previously obtained lease:

    $ dora -r -s xx.xx.xx.xx eth0

    The DHCP server must be specified. There is no output.

To obtain local network information on an interface already configured with
static IP address:

    $ dora -i eth0
    192.168.1.117 255.255.254.0 192.168.1.255 192.168.0.1 8.8.8.8 localdomain 192.168.1.254 0

    This uses a DHCPINFORM message. The server's response will either not
    include a lease time (because it is not a lease) so it is reported as 0, or
    it will report the remaining seconds for an existing lease.

Options:

    -c ipaddress - request client address

        For normal DHCP, this defines a desired IP address, which the server is
        under no obligation to provide. For other operations if this is
        specified it will be used instead of the existing interface address.

    -d - just broadcast a discover and print all offers

        This is for testing, it can be used to find DHCP servers active on the
        interface. If servers are found, exits with status 0, else with status
        1. The extended output format is used for each response (see below).
        Add -o or -O to see options provided by each server.

    -f - force lease acquisition even if interface already has an address

        Normally dora will refuse to request an IP address if the interface
        already has one, use -f to make it try anyway. Note this may invalidate
        the existing lease, if the result has a different IP address then the
        interface should be reconfigured.

    -h hostname - request specific hostname

        Some DHCP servers will register the specified hostname with the local
        DNS server, so that it will resolve to the assigned IP. Some won't.
        YMMV.

    -i - elicit local network information for current interface address.

        This can be used to obtain DHCP information for a static IP address,
        without actually leasing the address. If the address actually is
        assigned by DHCP, the server may choose to populate the lease field
        with the remaining time. Or not.

    -l - renew the lease for the current interface address, requires -s

        Renew the current lease. This is typically performed at time T1 (lease
        * 0.5 seconds). The DHCP server address is required. Add -c to renew
        * some other address, but note if the interface doesn't have that
        address then the response may not be received.

    -L - rebind the lease for the current interface address

        If renew fails for some reason, the rebind is sent at time T2 (lease *
        0.875 seconds). This is broadcast so the server address isn't required.
        If the rebind fails, then the interface is supposed to be de-configured
        when the lease expires. Add -c to rebind some other address.

    -o number - request DHCP option 1 to 254, can used multple times, implies -x

        Dora always requests the subnet, router, dns server, domain  name,
        broadcast address, and lease seconds from the server. This allows you
        to request other options as well, which the server may or may not
        respond to.

    -O - request all 254 possible DHCP options, implies -x

        This is simply shorthand for "-o1 -o2 -o3..." etc, an easy way to probe
        a server for optionms it supports. Useful with -d.

    -r - release the lease for the current interface address, requires -s

        Attempts to release the lease for the current address. -s is required,
        but the server won't respond. Add -c to release some other address.

     -s ipaddress - unicast to DHCP server address.

        Used with various operations that require knowledge of the target DHCP
        server. The interface must already be configured with an IP address in
        order for unicast to work.

     -t number - initial receive timeout seconds, default is 4

     -u number - transmit attempts, default is 4

        This defines how many times to resend a DHCPREQUEST if an ACK is not
        received. Note each attempt extends the timeout by about one second
        (randomized), so "-t 4 -u 4" will timeout after about 22 seconds, "-t 4
        -u 5" will timeout after about 30 seconds, etc.

     -v - dump various status messages and other information to stderr

        Includes dump of the sent as received packets, explanation as to why
        packets are rejected, etc. This information always goes to stderr so
        will not interfere with scripted output processing.

     -x - output extended result report to stdout, one DHCP option per line

        This supercedes the single-line output format, and prints each received
        DHCP option in the form:

            option description: value

        Where:

            "option" is the decimal option number, as defined at
            https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2132.

            "description" is arbitrary text from that RFC, guaranteed to not
            contains spaces.

            "value" is a stringified version of whatever was provided by the
            server for the option, such as an IP address, a decimal value, or
            an arbitrary string. Note that strings may contain whitespace, or
            may even be empty, but control characters and non-ASCII weirdness
            will be replaced with '?'.

        Option code 0 is used to present the assigned IP address. 0 is not an
        actual DHCP option code so this allows all lines the have the same
        format.

        Some options are mandatory for normal operation, specifically the
        subnet, broadcast, router, domain name server, domain name, and lease
        time. If the server fails to provide these then dora will attempt
        synthesize them. Synthesized options are indicated by an exclamation
        point as the first character of the extended description.

        For example, the expanded version of the DHCPINFORM reponse shown
        above, with all options:

            $ ./dora -iOx eth0
            0 Address: 192.168.1.117
            51 !IP_Address_Lease_Seconds: 0
            53 DHCP_Response_Type: 5
            54 Server_Identifier: 192.168.1.254
            1 Subnet_Mask: 255.255.254.0
            28 Broadcast_Address: 192.168.1.255
            6 Domain_Name_Server: 8.8.8.8
            252 Unknown: 10
            44 NetBIOS_Over_TCP/IP_Name_Server: 192.168.1.253
            15 Domain_Name: localdomain
            3 Router: 192.168.0.1

        This is all the options provided by the server, in this case including
        option 252 which is not defined by the spec. A DHCPINFORM reply usually
        won't include lease seconds, so this entry was synthesized.
